# Nexum — Hypothesis Priority Queue

The curated priority queue consumed by the autonomous research agent loop. Ordered highest-priority first. The agent always selects from the top of this queue, subject to gate and blocking constraints.

Priority score formula: `(commercial_value × scientific_novelty × tractability) / (compute_cost × time_to_signal)`

All scores are manually assigned; reviewed weekly by a human. The agent reads from this queue rather than computing its own score. See `docs/research/methodology.md` for the statistical plan template each hypothesis must complete before an experiment is run.
