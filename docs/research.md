# Nexum — Research Plan

## Mission

Build a typed-link retrieval substrate over a Postgres-native block graph that gives heterogeneous document corpora — legal, medical, research, enterprise — auditable answers, real-time ingest, and a domain-tunable training signal, with an optional frozen-snapshot deployment path for latency-sensitive or air-gapped use.

---

## Core Thesis

> Nexum is a typed-link retrieval substrate over a Postgres-native block graph, with three differentiating properties:
> 1. **Block-level provenance** — every generated answer traces back to the specific blocks that produced it, in a way dense transformer weights structurally cannot.
> 2. **Real-time ingest with version-atomic visibility** — new content is queryable end-to-end within a bounded window, with consistent snapshots across version cuts.
> 3. **Typed link structure as contrastive training signal** — `cites / contradicts / supports / elaborates / is-exception-to` edges are a curriculum substrate for domain fine-tunes that flat corpora cannot produce.
>
> The same store optionally feeds a frozen-snapshot deployment path (distilled student → GGUF/Safetensors) for latency-sensitive or air-gapped environments where graph-resident retrieval is unacceptable.

This thesis is novel where it matters, falsifiable, and tied to design-partner-visible artifacts. Earlier framings — "graph replaces ONNX/GGUF weight files," "live inference substrate," "isomorphism between training and serving" — overpromised. They are dropped. What survives below is the engineering program that the original framing was concealing.

The research plan below tests this thesis systematically. See `docs/research-plan-review-2026-04-27.md` for the review that drove this reframe and `docs/research/cut.md` (forthcoming) for the audit trail of demoted/cut hypotheses.

## Research Areas

### Area 1 — Storage Architecture Fitness

**Question:** For a given institution (legal firm, hospital, research lab, enterprise), what storage configuration minimizes total cost of ownership across ingestion throughput, query latency, storage footprint, and update fidelity?

**Sub-questions:**
- How does corpus heterogeneity (mixed document types, languages, schemas) affect the fitness of pure-relational vs. pure-graph vs. hybrid storage?
- At what corpus scale does PostgreSQL's recursive CTE traversal become the binding constraint, and what is the crossover point to a dedicated graph DB (Kuzu, Neptune, TigerGraph)?
- Is pgvector HNSW still optimal for ANN search at 100M+ blocks, or does a dedicated vector store (Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus) pay off?
- How much does schema rigidity vs. JSONB flexibility matter across domains?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H1.1 [KEEP]:** PostgreSQL with pgvector is sufficient for corpora below 20M blocks with mixed document types, with no measurable query quality degradation vs. a specialized graph DB.
- **H1.2 [TIGHTEN]:** Heterogeneous corpora (PDFs + structured tables + code) degrade embedding quality more than they degrade structural link quality — graph traversal outperforms semantic search in cross-type queries. *Tighten:* define "cross-type query" with a concrete eval set; specify "degrades embedding quality" quantitatively (recall@k delta, not adjective).
- **H1.3 [DEMOTE → measurement]:** For a single-institution deployment, embedding storage dominates total DB size (> 70%) at 1536 dimensions. *This is arithmetic.* Compute once, document in a sizing memo, and use it to motivate quantization work — do not run as an experiment.

**Experiments:**
- Synthetic benchmark: build corpora at 1M / 5M / 20M / 100M blocks across 3 domain mixes (legal, medical, mixed). Measure query latency P50/P99 for all three query modes at each scale.
- Schema comparison: deploy same corpus into PostgreSQL, Kuzu, and Neo4j. Compare traversal time for 2-hop, 4-hop, 6-hop queries on the same link graph.
- Embedding dimension ablation: test 512 / 768 / 1024 / 1536 dimensions. Measure recall@10 on domain-specific test sets to find the minimum useful dimensionality per domain.

---

### Area 2 — Graph as Training Curriculum

**Question:** Can the typed link graph in Nexum serve directly as a training curriculum for a language model, and if so, what curriculum construction strategies produce the best downstream performance?

**Sub-questions:**
- Does link type (cites / contradicts / elaborates / supports / is-exception-to) encode enough signal to generate useful contrastive training pairs?
- Can a walk policy over the block graph produce training sequences that outperform random sampling of the same corpus?
- Does block-level dedup (shared UUIDs across document versions) naturally produce curriculum diversity, or does it create repetition artifacts?
- What is the minimum graph density (links per block) before curriculum-derived training improves over a flat corpus baseline?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H2.1 [KEEP — most novel hypothesis in the plan]:** Contrastive pairs drawn from `contradicts` and `supports` links produce better domain classification fine-tunes than randomly sampled pairs from the same corpus. *Required baseline:* RAG-only over the same corpus, in addition to flat-corpus training.
- **H2.2 [KEEP]:** A BFS walk policy seeded from high-centrality blocks produces more coherent training sequences than random walk, as measured by next-token perplexity on held-out domain text. *Tighten:* add a power analysis on perplexity deltas before running.
- **H2.3 [TIGHTEN]:** The `ai` link layer (LLM-classified) produces higher-quality training signal than the `structural` layer for tasks requiring reasoning, while `structural` is superior for factual retrieval. *Tighten:* "reasoning vs. retrieval" must be a concrete task split with named benchmarks (e.g., MultiHop-RAG for reasoning, CUAD/LEDGAR clause extraction for retrieval), not adjectives.
- **H2.4 [TIGHTEN]:** Training on graph-derived sequences generalizes better across document versions (version-delta test sets) than flat-corpus training. *Tighten:* the version-delta test set must be constructed and named before this is runnable; specify document source, version count, and edit-type mix.

**Experiments:**
- Construct curriculum from a legal corpus (e.g., 10K contracts). Fine-tune a base LM on three curricula: (a) flat random, (b) BFS walk over structural links, (c) contrastive pairs from AI links. Evaluate on clause extraction and contradiction detection tasks.
- Vary graph density by threshold: include only AI links with confidence > 0.5, > 0.7, > 0.9. Measure downstream task performance as a function of link confidence cutoff.
- Ablate link type: train separate models with only `structural`, only `semantic`, only `ai` links. Compare on 3 tasks per domain.

### Area 3 — Retrieval-Augmented Inference over the Block Graph

**Question:** When a transformer client treats the block graph as its retrieval store, what client architecture minimizes overhead, and where does the latency floor sit relative to vanilla RAG and to a static-weights baseline?

This area was previously framed as "graph replaces static weight files." That framing is dropped. The honest engineering question is: how good can typed-link, provenance-aware RAG over our store get, and at what latency? Parametric weights are not being eliminated — they are being augmented with a structured, real-time retrieval substrate.

**Sub-questions:**
- What client architecture minimizes overhead? (sparse cross-attention over retrieved blocks, iterative retrieve-then-generate, agentic multi-step retrieval)
- What latency multiplier does the retrieval-augmented path carry vs. plain parametric inference for equivalent tasks?
- Does typed-link retrieval (filtering / weighting by `cites`, `contradicts`, etc.) measurably improve answer quality over flat-vector RAG?
- What update granularity is required end-to-end for a freshly inserted block to influence the next inference call?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H3.1 [TIGHTEN]:** For factoid Q&A over a corpus updated in the last 24 hours, a graph-resident inference client outperforms **RAG over a stale snapshot** of the same corpus on recency-sensitive questions. *Baseline corrected:* the original "stale fine-tuned model" baseline made the experiment a tautology. The interesting question is whether typed-link retrieval beats vanilla RAG with the same recency, or whether all the gain is just from the freshness of the index. Use FreshQA-style construction.
- **H3.2 [KEEP]:** The latency gap between graph-resident inference and static model inference can be bounded to 20–50x (not 1000x) with a two-tier cache: hot blocks (high degree, recent access) in memory, cold blocks on disk-backed HNSW.
- **H3.3 [TIGHTEN]:** A transformer with sparse cross-attention over ANN-retrieved blocks produces outputs competitive with a comparably sized static model on summarization tasks, while accessing only 1–5% of the graph per inference call. *Tighten:* drop BLEU/ROUGE — they are weak signal in 2026. Use a calibrated LM-as-judge rubric or a current-gen summarization benchmark with human spot-check.
- ~~H3.4 [CUT]:~~ "Inserting a new block propagates to inference within one query cycle." *This is a tautology* — it is the definition of a coherent read-after-write, not a hypothesis. Tracked as a system invariant under Area 5 instead.

**Experiments:**
- Latency benchmark: implement a minimal graph-inference client (ANN retrieval → block aggregation → LM generation). Measure tokens/sec vs. llama.cpp GGUF baseline on same hardware for 5 task types.
- Cache tier experiment: simulate Zipfian access patterns over 1M blocks. Measure hit rates and effective latency with in-memory cache sizes of 1%, 5%, 10% of corpus.
- Knowledge recency test: take a corpus with a known "fact change" (e.g., a contract amendment). Update only the delta blocks in the graph. Compare graph-resident client vs. static model on questions that depend on the amendment.
- Sparse attention ablation: implement retrieval-augmented generation where the number of retrieved blocks per step varies (k=1, 5, 10, 50, 100). Plot task performance vs. latency.

### Area 4 — Provenance, Compositional Reasoning, and Single-Store Properties

**Question:** What does using one Postgres store for retrieval, training, and serving — i.e. *colocation* — actually buy, and where does it break down? (The earlier "isomorphism" framing is dropped: colocation is not a structure-preserving correspondence in the mathematical sense; it just removes a sync seam.)

**Sub-questions:**
- Does block-level provenance produce visibly better auditability for legal/medical buyers than vanilla-RAG citation lists?
- Does a unified store reduce train/serve skew bugs in practice? *(Phrased as a measurement, not as a hypothesis with a fabricated effect size.)*
- Are there tasks where parametric weights are strictly superior regardless of recency, e.g., compositional reasoning that cannot be decomposed into block-level retrieval?
- What is the minimum model size for the retrieval-augmented client to be competitive?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H4.1 [TIGHTEN]:** For tasks that decompose into graph queries, a retrieval-augmented client with block-level provenance produces more auditable outputs than a static model, with no accuracy penalty. *Tighten:* "more auditable" requires an operational definition — attribution F1 against expert-labeled spans, or expert-rater agreement scores.
- **H4.2 [KEEP]:** Multi-step compositional reasoning ("does clause A in contract X override clause B in contract Y given law Z?") requires ≥ 3-hop graph traversal; retrieval-augmented clients only match static-model accuracy above a minimum graph-density threshold.
- ~~H4.3 [CUT / REFRAME]:~~ "Train/serve skew accounts for > 30% of retrieval failures in two-store systems." *The 30% number is fabricated.* Recast as a measurement study — instrument a representative two-store deployment, count the skew-attributable failures, and report what we find. No a priori threshold.
- **H4.4 [KEEP — highest-value hypothesis commercially; lead with this]:** The graph's typed links enable attribution — tracing exactly which blocks contributed to a generated answer — with < 5% false attribution rate, something structurally impossible for dense transformer weights.

> **Note on terminology:** earlier drafts referred to "isomorphism" between training, retrieval, and inference stores. That term is mathematically loaded (structure-preserving correspondence) and overstates the claim. The actual property is *colocation* — one Postgres database for all three roles, which removes a sync seam. The architectural footnote is true and useful; the rhetorical lift was not.

**Experiments:**
- Adversarial skew test: deliberately introduce a 24-hour lag between corpus update and model re-training. Measure task degradation. Then repeat with graph-resident client on the same updated corpus. Compare.
- Compositional reasoning benchmark: construct multi-hop question sets requiring 2, 3, 4, 5 hops through the link graph. Measure accuracy as a function of hops for graph-resident vs. static model.
- Attribution audit: on a held-out QA set, collect predicted source blocks from the graph-resident client. Have domain experts verify attribution accuracy.

### Area 5 — Update Semantics and Live Consistency

**Question:** When one store simultaneously serves as knowledge base, training curriculum, and inference target, what are the consistency guarantees required for the "real-time updating model" claim to hold — and what breaks when they are violated?

The real-time-ingest claim assumes that inserting a block into the graph immediately makes that knowledge available at retrieval time. This is not trivially true. Embeddings must be computed, HNSW indexes must be updated, link classifiers must run, and any cached retrieval state must be invalidated. The question is how much of this must be synchronous before the system can credibly advertise real-time behavior, and what the practical latency floor is.

**Sub-questions:**
- What is the end-to-end latency from block insertion to that block being retrievable in an inference call — broken down by pipeline stage (embed, index, link, cache invalidation)?
- Is partial visibility safe? If a block is embedded and indexed but its AI links haven't been classified yet, does serving it degrade inference quality or produce inconsistent results?
- How does update contention behave under high-ingest conditions? If 10K blocks are inserted simultaneously (e.g., a new document version), does HNSW index build time create a retrieval dead zone?
- Can the versioning model (shared block UUIDs across document versions) be exploited to make updates atomic at the version level — presenting a consistent snapshot to inference clients while the new version is being indexed?
- What is the minimum embedding refresh granularity? If a block's content changes slightly (typo fix, metadata update), does its embedding drift enough to matter for retrieval, and can drift be detected cheaply without re-embedding the full corpus?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H5.1 [KEEP]:** End-to-end insertion-to-retrieval latency is dominated by the HNSW index update step (not embedding or link classification), and can be reduced below 500ms for single-block inserts by deferring index consolidation to a background process.
- **H5.2 [KEEP]:** Serving partially-linked blocks (embedded + indexed but AI links not yet classified) degrades inference quality by less than 5% on reasoning tasks — embedding alone carries most of the retrieval signal; link classification is a quality enhancement, not a correctness requirement.
- **H5.3 [KEEP]:** Version-level atomicity eliminates partial-visibility artifacts at the cost of a latency window proportional to document size; that window is acceptable for typical institutional documents. *Tighten:* tie the acceptance criterion to a real document-length distribution drawn from a partner corpus, not the arbitrary "500 pages" placeholder.
- **H5.4 [KEEP — cleanest hypothesis in the document]:** Embedding drift after minor content edits (< 5% token change) is below the retrieval discrimination threshold for 95% of blocks; selective re-embedding triggered by content-hash change is sufficient.
- **H5.5 [KEEP]:** Under high-ingest load (10K blocks/minute), a write-optimized insertion path (defer HNSW index build, serve new blocks via sequential scan until index catches up) outperforms a synchronous index-on-insert path in end-to-end query recall.

**Experiments:**
- Insertion latency breakdown: instrument the ingestion pipeline to record time at each stage (parse, embed, index insert, link classify, cache invalidate). Measure P50/P99 for single-block and batch (1K block) inserts.
- Partial-visibility eval: build a 100-question eval set. Answer each question at three pipeline stages: (a) after embedding only, (b) after structural links, (c) after AI links. Measure accuracy delta across stages.
- Version atomicity test: ingest a 500-page document. Measure the wall-clock window between first block insert and full version availability. Evaluate inference quality at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% indexing completion.
- Embedding drift detection: take 10K blocks. Apply random minor edits (1–10% token substitution). Re-embed and measure cosine distance to original. Identify the token-change threshold at which retrieval rank shifts by more than 3 positions.
- High-ingest contention: simulate 10K blocks/minute ingest against a live query workload. Compare synchronous index-on-insert vs. deferred index consolidation on query recall and ingest throughput.

### Area 6 — GPU Acceleration for PostgreSQL Extensions

**Question:** Can GPU-accelerated operations inside PostgreSQL close the efficiency gap between graph-resident inference and static model inference — and which pipeline stages benefit most, including when the corpus is too large to fit in VRAM?

The order-of-magnitude latency penalty of retrieval-augmented inference over the block graph comes from three places: ANN retrieval (HNSW graph walk on CPU), embedding computation (either network round-trip or CPU inference), and aggregation (weighted sum or attention over retrieved block vectors). All three are parallelizable. GPUs are already the standard compute substrate for embedding models and attention. The question is whether bringing that compute inside — or immediately adjacent to — the PostgreSQL process is architecturally viable and worth the operational complexity.

A secondary and under-examined dimension is **GPU paging**: for extremely large Nexum deployments (100M+ blocks), the embedding matrix alone (100M × 1536 × 4 bytes ≈ 600 GB float32, or ~75 GB at int8) cannot fit in a single GPU's VRAM. This requires a tiered GPU memory strategy analogous to the CPU hot/cold cache in H3.2, but operating across VRAM → system RAM → NVMe with different latency characteristics and CUDA-specific constraints (pinned memory, UVM, peer access).

**Sub-questions:**
- Which operation in the inference step function (ANN retrieval, embedding, aggregation/attention) has the highest GPU speedup potential, and what is the crossover corpus size at which GPU wins?
- Can pgml's in-process model execution be extended to GPU-backed inference (via CUDA or ROCm), and what is the memory pressure implication for the Postgres buffer pool?
- Is a GPU-colocated sidecar (a small inference server on the same host, accessed via Unix socket) a better architecture than true in-process GPU execution for latency and operational simplicity?
- For the HNSW index specifically: do GPU-accelerated ANN libraries (FAISS-GPU, cuVS/RAFT) outperform pgvector's CPU HNSW at the corpus scales relevant to Nexum (1M–100M blocks), and can their indexes be kept in sync with the Postgres block table?
- Does batching inference requests (accumulating N queries before a GPU kernel launch) improve throughput enough to offset the added latency, and what is the optimal batch size per corpus scale?
- **GPU paging:** When the embedding corpus exceeds VRAM, what is the optimal tiering strategy across VRAM / pinned system RAM / NVMe? Can CUDA Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) or GPUDirect Storage manage this transparently, or does explicit shard management (Zipfian hot-shard promotion into VRAM) outperform automatic paging?
- Can the Nexum block graph's access patterns (high-degree blocks are disproportionately retrieved) be exploited to pre-load the top-N% of blocks by in-degree into VRAM, achieving near-full-fit performance even when the full corpus is 10x VRAM capacity?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- ~~H6.1 [DEMOTE → cite]:~~ "GPU ANN > 10x CPU HNSW at 10M+ blocks." *Already established in the cuVS / FAISS-GPU literature.* Cite published numbers in our sizing memo; do not re-benchmark as a Nexum finding. We benchmark only the Nexum-specific question of whether GPU ANN can be kept in sync with the Postgres block table (tracked under Area 5 / Area 6 engineering).
- **H6.2 [TIGHTEN]:** In-process GPU embedding reduces single-block embedding latency below 5ms, making HNSW index update the new binding constraint. *Tighten:* tie the claim to a specific embedding model and hardware SKU; the threshold is meaningless without them.
- **H6.3 [KEEP]:** A GPU-colocated sidecar accessed via Unix socket achieves within 20% of true in-process GPU latency, with significantly lower operational complexity — making it the preferred architecture over modifying the Postgres process directly. (Architecturally important; the answer changes the deployment story.)
- **H6.4 [KEEP]:** Batched GPU inference (batch size 32–128) improves throughput by > 5x vs. single-query GPU inference; the added queuing latency is acceptable for non-interactive workloads. (Standard but worth measuring on Nexum's actual workload.)
- **H6.5 [KEEP — most interesting GPU hypothesis]:** For a corpus that is 10x VRAM capacity, explicit hot-shard management (top 10% of blocks by in-degree pinned in VRAM) achieves > 80% of full-fit GPU throughput, whereas CUDA UVM automatic paging achieves < 30% due to page-fault overhead on irregular ANN access patterns.
- **H6.6 [KEEP]:** The Nexum block graph's access distribution is sufficiently Zipfian — measured empirically across real institution corpora — that a 10% VRAM footprint covers > 70% of inference retrievals, making the hot-shard strategy practical without per-institution tuning.

**Experiments:**
- ANN benchmark: load 10M blocks into pgvector (CPU HNSW), FAISS-GPU (flat + IVF), and cuVS/RAFT HNSW. Measure throughput (queries/sec) and recall@10 at equivalent index build time. Run on same GPU hardware.
- Embedding latency breakdown: compare (a) OpenAI API round-trip, (b) CPU-local model via pgml, (c) GPU-local model via pgml + CUDA. Measure P50/P99 for single and batched (32, 128) requests.
- Sidecar vs. in-process: implement both architectures. Measure latency for the full inference step function (ANN + embed + aggregate). Compare on a 1000-query workload.
- Batch size sweep: for GPU embedding and GPU ANN, sweep batch sizes 1, 8, 32, 128, 512. Measure throughput and P99 latency. Identify the knee of the curve.
- Buffer pool pressure: measure Postgres shared_buffers hit rate before and after loading a GPU-backed embedding model into the process. Quantify eviction pressure on the block table data pages.
- GPU paging benchmark: synthesize a corpus at 2x, 5x, 10x VRAM capacity. Compare three strategies: (a) CUDA UVM automatic paging, (b) explicit hot-shard pinning (top-N% by in-degree), (c) CPU HNSW fallback for cold shards + GPU for hot. Measure throughput and recall@10 across strategies.
- Access distribution measurement: instrument a live Nexum query workload across 3 institution-type corpora (legal, medical, mixed). Plot block retrieval frequency rank-order distribution. Fit a Zipf curve. Measure what fraction of retrievals are served by the top 5%, 10%, 20% of blocks.

### Area 7 — Frozen Artifact Export (ONNX / Safetensors / GGUF from the Graph)

**Question:** Can the Nexum graph be compiled into a standard optimized inference artifact — ONNX, Safetensors, or GGUF — that captures the knowledge state of the store at a point in time, enabling high-performance static inference where the latency penalty of graph-resident inference is unacceptable?

The colocated store is the live, authoritative source of knowledge. But some deployments — mobile, edge, latency-critical APIs, air-gapped environments — cannot tolerate the 20–50x latency penalty of retrieval-augmented inference even with GPU acceleration (Area 6). The answer is to treat the graph as a compiler input: periodically "freeze" its current state into a standard weights artifact, deploy that artifact for high-performance static inference, and accept that the frozen artifact is a snapshot — current as of its export timestamp — while the live graph continues to update.

The research question is whether a graph-derived frozen artifact is competitive with a conventionally trained model of equivalent parameter count, and what the right export architecture looks like.

**Sub-questions:**
- What graph-to-weights compilation strategies exist? Options include: distillation (train a small student model on graph-derived curriculum from Area 2), direct embedding matrix export (pack block embeddings into a retrieval-optimized weight format), and attention weight synthesis (construct transformer attention matrices from link weights and embeddings).
- What is the fidelity loss from freezing — how quickly does a frozen artifact become stale relative to the live graph, and what is the right re-export cadence per institution type?
- Can the typed link structure (rel_type, weight, layer) be encoded into the frozen artifact's weights such that the static model inherits relationship-aware behavior, rather than treating all knowledge as flat?
- Is GGUF, Safetensors, or ONNX the right target format for a graph-distilled model? They have different trade-offs in quantization support, operator coverage, and ecosystem tooling.
- What is the minimum corpus size / graph density at which a frozen graph-derived model outperforms a conventionally trained model of the same parameter count on domain-specific tasks?

**Hypotheses to test:**
- **H7.1 [TIGHTEN]:** A student model distilled from a graph-derived curriculum (Area 2) and exported to GGUF achieves within 10% task accuracy of the retrieval-augmented client on the same benchmark, at 100x lower inference latency. *Tighten:* aggressive — name the student model architecture/parameter count, the named benchmark, and the eval protocol up front. Add a power analysis.
- **H7.2 [KEEP — the one genuinely novel idea in Area 7]:** Encoding link weights and `rel_type` as soft attention biases during distillation produces a frozen model that outperforms a distilled model trained on flat corpus by > 8% on multi-hop reasoning tasks — demonstrating that the typed-link graph structure survives compilation into weights.
- **H7.3 [TIGHTEN]:** The staleness penalty of a frozen artifact grows non-trivially with corpus update rate. *Tighten:* the originally asserted functional form ("super-linear above 1000 blocks/day") is not derived. Drop the form. Run a staleness sweep across update rates and report the measured curve, then fit post-hoc — do not pre-commit to a shape.
- ~~H7.4 [DEMOTE → KPI]:~~ "GGUF export pipeline runs in < 4 hours on a 10M-block corpus." *This is an engineering timing target, not a hypothesis.* Track as a roadmap KPI on the export-pipeline workstream.
- **H7.5 [TIGHTEN → engineering bake-off]:** Safetensors vs. ONNX vs. GGUF as intermediate formats. *Tighten:* run as an engineering bake-off with a written decision memo, not as a research finding. The interesting comparison is partial-loading semantics for the embedding matrix; framing it as a "hypothesis" overstates its novelty.

> **Risk concentration:** Area 7 depends on Area 2 producing a non-trivial typed-link curriculum signal. If H2.1–H2.4 come back lukewarm, Area 7's distillation pipeline collapses to standard fine-tuning and loses its differentiating story. The remediation Step 6 wedge demo is specifically structured to surface this dependency early — Area 7 staffing waits until the Area 2 signal is observed.

**Experiments:**
- Distillation pipeline: implement graph → curriculum (Area 2 BFS walk) → student model fine-tune → GGUF export. Evaluate on 3 domain benchmarks vs. graph-resident client and vs. conventionally trained baseline.
- Link-encoded distillation: compare two distillation runs — (a) flat sequence training, (b) attention-bias-injected training using link weights. Measure multi-hop reasoning accuracy delta.
- Staleness curve: export a frozen artifact daily for 2 weeks while continuously ingesting updates into the live graph. Measure accuracy on a stable held-out eval set each day. Plot accuracy vs. days-since-export at different update rates (10, 100, 1000, 10K blocks/day).
- Export pipeline timing: instrument the full export pipeline. Measure wall-clock time per stage (curriculum generation, distillation training, quantization, GGUF pack) at corpus sizes 1M, 5M, 10M blocks.
- Format comparison: export the same distilled model to ONNX, Safetensors, and GGUF. Measure cold-load time, warm inference latency, quantization fidelity at int8 and int4, and ecosystem tooling compatibility (llama.cpp, HuggingFace transformers, ONNX Runtime).

## Open Questions (not yet hypotheses)

These are not yet falsifiable but need conceptual resolution before experiments can be designed:

1. **Client architecture:** What is the right abstraction for a "graph-resident inference client"? Is it a transformer with retrieval-augmented attention, a differentiable memory network, a chain-of-thought agent, or something novel?
2. **Curriculum ordering:** BFS/DFS over the link graph is a natural walk, but is there a principled way to derive a total ordering of blocks that maximizes information gain per training step?
3. **Update atomicity:** When a block is updated in a live production corpus, which downstream inference operations need to be invalidated? Can a dependency graph over cached inference results be maintained cheaply?
4. **Embedding drift:** If blocks share a UUID across versions but the content changes (via `parent_block_id` lineage), the embedding is stale. How do we detect and manage embedding drift without re-embedding the entire corpus?
5. **Multi-tenancy:** Different institutions have different privacy requirements. Does the colocation property (one store = training + retrieval + serving) create unacceptable data leakage risk in shared-infrastructure deployments?

## Agent Loop Protocol

For autonomous research agents operating over this plan:

1. **Select** the next hypothesis from the **curated priority queue** maintained in `docs/research/queue.md`. Each entry carries a manually assigned score:
   `priority = (commercial_value × scientific_novelty × tractability) / (compute_cost × time_to_signal)`
   The queue is reviewed weekly by a human; the autonomous loop reads from it rather than computing its own score. *(The previous UCB-based selection is retired: bandit selection presumes commensurable reward, which recall@10, fine-tune accuracy delta, and tokens/sec do not provide. UCB systematically chases the noisiest evals.)*
2. **Operationalize** the selected hypothesis into a concrete experiment spec: dataset, metric, **named baseline** (from the prior-art list in `methodology.md`), intervention, **statistical plan** (n, power, CI), **compute budget**, and a **kill-criterion spike** — the smallest experiment, in days, that decides keep-or-drop.
3. **Execute** the spike first. If the spike passes, run the full experiment. Write results as a new block linked to the hypothesis block with `rel_type: supports | contradicts | inconclusive`.
4. **Spawn** child hypotheses sparingly: for each supported hypothesis, generate a more specific version; for each contradicted hypothesis, generate an alternative explanation. Children inherit the design-partner question from the parent or are not spawned.
5. **Prune** hypotheses superseded by results. Mark with a `confirmed: false` link from the child hypothesis block back to the parent.
6. **Escalate** to a human reviewer after every 5 cycles, or whenever a result contradicts a previously supported hypothesis, or when the wedge-demo (remediation Step 6) gates the next area's staffing.

Every hypothesis, experiment spec, result, and child hypothesis is stored as a block in the Nexum graph, making the research process itself a first-class corpus.

## Methodology and Product Scaffolding

The 2026-04-27 review (`docs/research-plan-review-2026-04-27.md`) flagged that this plan was missing both methodological scaffolding (statistical plans, prior-art baselines, named evals, null-result protocol, compute budgets) and product scaffolding (design partners, time-to-signal spikes, buy-vs-build calls, demos, pricing surfaces, buyer's-bar evals).

These scaffolds live alongside this plan rather than inline:

- `docs/research/methodology.md` *(forthcoming)* — standard evals adopted (BEIR, MTEB, FreshQA, LegalBench, MIRAGE, MultiHop-RAG, plus 3–5 institution-shaped sets), statistical plan template, prior-art baseline list (LlamaIndex, Vespa, ColBERT, RAPTOR, GraphRAG, MemGPT) with which hypothesis each baselines, compute-budget template, and the **null-result protocol** specifying when the program terminates.
- `docs/research/queue.md` *(forthcoming)* — the curated priority queue consumed by the agent loop above.
- `docs/research/cut.md` *(forthcoming)* — audit trail of CUT and DEMOTE'd hypotheses with one-line reasons.
- `docs/research/pricing-surfaces.md` *(forthcoming)* — mapping from hypothesis outputs to invoice lines (blocks/month, queries/month, audit-grade tier, etc.).

Per-hypothesis frontmatter is being extended (in `docs/research/hypotheses/`) to include: `baselines:`, `compute_budget:`, `design_partner_question:`, `demo:`, `kill_criterion_spike:`. Any hypothesis whose `design_partner_question` is empty after Step 4 of the remediation plan is reclassified as exploratory and not staffed until a partner asks.

### The wedge demo (remediation Step 6)

Sequencing is gated on a single end-to-end wedge demo combining **H4.4 (block-level provenance)** + a slice of **H2.1 (typed-link contrastive signal)** + **H5.1 / H5.2 (real-time ingest)** on one legal or medical partner corpus. If the wedge does not produce visibly better answers than vanilla RAG and two design partners do not engage within four weeks, the program reverts to a pure systems-research project — Areas 1, 5, 6 only — and the curriculum / retrieval-inference / frozen-export thread is shelved until a customer pulls. This is the program's null-result protocol.
